# Welcome to the Orientation Module of the MIT Big Data and Social Analytics certificate course.

In order to provide you with the best learning experience, we have selected technologies that will aid and accelerate your learning journey, while trying to keep the technical components or infrastructure-related tasks to a minimum.

Python is the preferred programming language of a large community of users for a wide variety of uses. We have selected Python for this course as it is easy to become productive in it after minimal exposure. There are multiple online training courses and free resources that will get you started and show you how to achieve your desired result.

The next step is to identify an interface that allows for the easy management of libraries as well as the sharing of your analysis work. The Jupyter Notebook family is the preferred tool of many data scientists as it enables the creation and sharing of result sets in which you can do your analysis and visualization, and revisit the steps where required. We have selected the Anaconda distribution as this contains a number of preinstalled, useful libraries.

When performing analyses, you will not always have the luxury of a powerful laptop, large server capacity, or a team of resources to create and maintain your environments and products utilized. Fortunately, you can set up a cloud-based environment that can be accessed from anywhere, with zero to minimal costs, to ensure that you are not dependent on expensive hardware and software products.

While you will not be an expert on all of the items in the ecosystem, you need to have a good understanding of all the components and options within various fields, from business and mathematics to statistics and technology.
